## Overview

GrapeQL is a comprehensive GraphQL security assessment toolkit designed to help security researchers and developers identify vulnerabilities in GraphQL implementations. Named after the fruit that grows in clusters, GrapeQL tests multiple security aspects of your GraphQL endpoint in parallel, providing thorough coverage of potential security issues.

Let me analyze the code and rewrite the Features section to accurately reflect the implemented classes.

## GrapeQL Usage Guide

GrapeQL is a GraphQL security testing tool that can identify and test for various denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities in GraphQL endpoints.

### Basic Usage

```bash
python3 main.py [-h] (-t TARGET | --api API) [-p PROXY] [-c] [-w WORDLIST]
```

#### Required Arguments

- `-t TARGET, --target TARGET`
  - Target IP address to scan
  - Example: `python3 graphql.py -t 192.168.1.100`

- `--api API`
  - Direct URL to test for GraphQL introspection
  - Bypasses port scanning and directory busting
  - Example: `python3 graphql.py --api http://example.com/graphql`

### Optional Arguments

- `-p PROXY, --proxy PROXY`
  - Optional proxy address in format host:port
  - Useful for intercepting traffic with tools like Burp Suite
  - Example: `python3 graphql.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 127.0.0.1:8080`

- `-c, --crush`
  - Use enhanced crush DoS testing instead of standard root testing
  - Includes additional test vectors like directory overloading
  - Example: `python3 graphql.py --api http://example.com/graphql -c`

- `-w WORDLIST, --wordlist WORDLIST`
  - Path to custom wordlist file for endpoint discovery
  - Example: `python3 graphql.py -t 192.168.1.100 -w custom_paths.txt`

- `-u USERNAME`
  - Name passed to the variable username in GraphQL queries

- `-pw PASSWORD`
  - Password passed to the variable password in GraphQL queries


## Example Usage Scenarios

1.Basic scan of an IP address:

```bash
python3 main.py -t 192.168.1.100
```

2.Direct testing of a known GraphQL endpoint with enhanced DoS testing:

```bash
python3 main.py --api http://example.com/graphql --crush
```

3.Testing through Burp Suite proxy with custom wordlist:

```bash
python3 main.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 127.0.0.1:8080 -w wordlist.txt
```

4.Full scan with all options:

```bash
python3 main.py -t 192.168.1.100 -p 127.0.0.1:8080 -w wordlist.txt -crush -u admin -pw changeme
```

## Notes

- When using the proxy option, ensure your proxy tool (e.g., Burp Suite) is properly configured
- The crush testing mode (-c) includes more aggressive tests that might impact application performance
- Custom wordlists should contain one path per line
- All HTTPS connections through proxy are made with SSL verification disabled

## Warning

This tool is intended for security testing with proper authorization. Unauthorized testing against systems you don't own or have permission to test may be illegal.

## Features

### 1. The Vine: Endpoint Discovery and Enumeration

- Automated port scanning with direct connection capabilities
- Concurrent directory busting for GraphQL endpoints
- Configurable endpoint path enumeration
- Built-in common GraphQL endpoint path detection
- Proxy support for HTTP operations through Burp Suite
- Introspection query testing to identify vulnerable endpoints
- Custom endpoint list configuration

### 2. Root Analysis: GraphQL Engine Detection

- Comprehensive GraphQL server implementation fingerprinting
- Support for detecting 25+ GraphQL engines including:
  - Apollo Server
  - GraphQL Yoga
  - AWS AppSync
  - Hasura
  - GraphQL PHP
  - Ruby GraphQL
  - And many more
- Detailed error message analysis
- Custom query generation for engine identification
- Proxy-aware implementation testing

### 3. Seeds: CSRF and Method Testing

- Field suggestion vulnerability detection
- GET-based mutation testing for CSRF vulnerabilities
- Query method support analysis
- POST-based CSRF testing with different content types
- Detailed vulnerability reporting including:
- Severity classification
- Impact assessment
- Verification commands (curl)
- Vulnerability descriptions

### 4. Juice: Command Injection Testing

- Schema-aware query generation for targeted testing
- Authenticated command injection testing

### 5. Crush: DoS Vulnerability Testing

- Schema-aware query generation for targeted testing
- Circular query vulnerability detection
- Field duplication attack testing
- Array batching vulnerability assessment
- Response time analysis for DoS detection
- Detailed vulnerability reporting
- Proxy support for request routing
- Introspection-based query customization
- Configurable test parameters

Each module is designed to work independently or as part of the complete suite, with built-in proxy support for integration with security testing tools like Burp Suite. The tools use asynchronous operations for efficient testing and provide detailed output through a custom printing system.

## Why GrapeQL?

Like a bunch of grapes, GraphQL endpoints have many interconnected parts that need to be tested thoroughly. GrapeQL tests each "grape" (component) while understanding how they connect to form the whole cluster (API). Our tool is designed to be sweet and simple to use, while providing comprehensive coverage.
