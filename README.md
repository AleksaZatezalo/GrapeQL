# üçá GrapeQL: The GraphQL Security Testing Suite

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 2025

## Overview
GrapeQL is a comprehensive GraphQL security assessment toolkit designed to help security researchers and developers identify vulnerabilities in GraphQL implementations. Named after the fruit that grows in clusters, GrapeQL tests multiple security aspects of your GraphQL endpoint in parallel, providing thorough coverage of potential security issues.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Required
Python 3.7+
pip package manager

# Optional
Docker (for isolated testing)
Burp Suite (for proxy integration)
```

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install grapeql
```

### Development Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AleksaZatezalo/grapeql
cd grapeql
```

## Security Recommendations

### Implementation Guidelines

1. Enable authentication for all sensitive queries
2. Implement proper rate limiting
3. Set query depth limits
4. Use query complexity analysis
5. Implement proper error handling
6. Enable logging and monitoring

## Best Practices

### Testing Methodology

1. Start with non-intrusive tests
2. Gradually increase test complexity
3. Monitor system response
4. Document all findings
5. Validate results manually

### Risk Mitigation

1. Test in staging environments first
2. Have rollback procedures ready
3. Monitor system resources
4. Maintain audit logs
5. Have incident response plans

## A Note on Responsible Testing

GrapeQL is a powerful testing tool. Always ensure you have explicit permission to test target systems and use the tool responsibly.

## Why GrapeQL?

Like a bunch of grapes, GraphQL endpoints have many interconnected parts that need to be tested thoroughly. GrapeQL tests each "grape" (component) while understanding how they connect to form the whole cluster (API). Our tool is designed to be sweet and simple to use, while providing comprehensive coverage.
