# üçá GrapeQL: The GraphQL Security Testing Suite

Version: 1.0
Last Updated: January 2025

## Overview
GrapeQL is a comprehensive GraphQL security assessment toolkit designed to help security researchers and developers identify vulnerabilities in GraphQL implementations. Named after the fruit that grows in clusters, GrapeQL tests multiple security aspects of your GraphQL endpoint in parallel, providing thorough coverage of potential security issues.

## Why GrapeQL?

Like a bunch of grapes, GraphQL endpoints have many interconnected parts that need to be tested thoroughly. GrapeQL tests each "grape" (component) while understanding how they connect to form the whole cluster (API). Our tool is designed to be sweet and simple to use, while providing comprehensive coverage.
