## Detailed Findings

### 1. Command Injection in systemDiagnostics.cmd

**Severity:** CRITICAL

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** Possible command injection in systemDiagnostics.cmd with payload: uname -a

**Impact:** Command execution on the server, allowing attacker to execute arbitrary code and potentially gain full system access

**Remediation:** Implement proper input validation, use parameterized queries, avoid passing user input to shell commands, and apply the principle of least privilege

---

### 2. DoS Vulnerability: Circular Query DoS

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to denial of service through circular query dos. Response time: 10.75 seconds.

**Impact:** Server resources can be exhausted, potentially causing service outages

**Remediation:** Implement query depth limiting, timeout controls, and query cost analysis

---

### 3. DoS Vulnerability: Field Duplication DoS

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to denial of service through field duplication dos. Response time: 10.97 seconds.

**Impact:** Server resources can be exhausted, potentially causing service outages

**Remediation:** Implement query depth limiting, timeout controls, and query cost analysis

---

### 4. DoS Vulnerability: Deeply Nested Query DoS

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to denial of service through deeply nested query dos. Response time: 11.00 seconds.

**Impact:** Server resources can be exhausted, potentially causing service outages

**Remediation:** Implement query depth limiting, timeout controls, and query cost analysis

---

### 5. DoS Vulnerability: Fragment Bomb DoS

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to denial of service through fragment bomb dos. Response time: 11.00 seconds.

**Impact:** Server resources can be exhausted, potentially causing service outages

**Remediation:** Implement query depth limiting, timeout controls, and query cost analysis

---

### 6. DoS Vulnerability: Array Batching Attack

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL endpoint is vulnerable to denial of service through array batching. Response time: 10.99 seconds.

**Impact:** Server resources can be exhausted by sending many queries in a single request

**Remediation:** Limit the number of operations allowed in a batch request

---

### 7. URL-encoded POST Queries Enabled (Possible CSRF)

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server accepts queries via URL-encoded form data, which may enable cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks

**Impact:** Attackers may be able to execute operations using the victim's credentials

**Remediation:** Only accept application/json content type for GraphQL operations

---

### 8. Introspection Enabled

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server has introspection enabled, which exposes detailed schema information

**Impact:** Attackers can map the entire GraphQL schema and discover available operations

**Remediation:** Disable introspection in production environments or implement authorization controls

---

### 9. Field Suggestions Enabled

**Severity:** LOW

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server is providing field suggestions in error messages, which can help attackers discover schema information

**Impact:** Information Leakage - Schema details are being disclosed

**Remediation:** Disable field suggestions in production environments

---

### 10. Query Batching Enabled

**Severity:** LOW

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server supports query batching, which can be used to amplify attacks

**Impact:** Attackers can send multiple operations in a single request, potentially bypassing rate limits

**Remediation:** Implement per-operation rate limiting and set maximum batch size limits

---

### 11. GraphQL Engine Identified: Graphene

**Severity:** INFO

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL engine was identified as Graphene.

**Impact:** None - informational only

**Remediation:** None required

---
