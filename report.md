Total: 6 findings

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Command Injection in systemDiagnostics.cmd

**Severity:** HIGH

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** Possible command injection in systemDiagnostics.cmd with payload: uname -a

**Impact:** Command execution on the server

**Remediation:** Implement proper input validation and sanitize user inputs

**Proof of Concept:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql -H 'Host:127.0.0.1:5013' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization:Bearer 12345' -H 'Accept:*/*' -H 'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate' -H 'User-Agent:Python/3.13 aiohttp/3.11.16' -H 'Cookie:session=test-cookie' -H 'Content-Length:162' -d '{"data":{"systemDiagnostics":"Linux 51986c44f586 5.15.167.4-microsoft-standard-WSL2 #1 SMP Tue Nov 5 00:21:55 UTC 2024 x86_64 Linux\n"}}'
```

### 2. URL-encoded POST Queries Enabled (Possible CSRF)

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server accepts queries via URL-encoded form data, which may enable cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks

**Impact:** Attackers may be able to execute operations using the victim's credentials

**Remediation:** Only accept application/json content type for GraphQL operations

**Proof of Concept:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql -H 'Host:127.0.0.1:5013' -H 'Content-Type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded' -H 'Authorization:Bearer 12345' -H 'Accept:*/*' -H 'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate' -H 'User-Agent:Python/3.13 aiohttp/3.11.16' -H 'Cookie:session=test-cookie' -H 'Content-Length:30' -d '{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}'
```

---

### 3. Introspection Enabled

**Severity:** MEDIUM

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server has introspection enabled, which exposes detailed schema information

**Impact:** Attackers can map the entire GraphQL schema and discover available operations

**Remediation:** Disable introspection in production environments or implement authorization controls

---

### 4. Field Suggestions Enabled

**Severity:** LOW

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server is providing field suggestions in error messages, which can help attackers discover schema information

**Impact:** Information Leakage - Schema details are being disclosed

**Remediation:** Disable field suggestions in production environments

**Proof of Concept:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql -H 'Host:127.0.0.1:5013' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization:Bearer 12345' -H 'Accept:*/*' -H 'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate' -H 'User-Agent:Python/3.13 aiohttp/3.11.16' -H 'Cookie:session=test-cookie' -H 'Content-Length:45' -d '{"errors":[{"message":"Cannot query field \"directive\" on type \"__Schema\". Did you mean \"directives\"?","locations":[{"line":1,"column":20}]}]}'
```

---

### 5. Query Batching Enabled

**Severity:** LOW

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL server supports query batching, which can be used to amplify attacks

**Impact:** Attackers can send multiple operations in a single request, potentially bypassing rate limits

**Remediation:** Implement per-operation rate limiting and set maximum batch size limits

**Proof of Concept:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql -H 'Host:127.0.0.1:5013' -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Authorization:Bearer 12345' -H 'Accept:*/*' -H 'Accept-Encoding:gzip, deflate' -H 'User-Agent:Python/3.13 aiohttp/3.11.16' -H 'Cookie:session=test-cookie' -H 'Content-Length:70' -d '[{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}},{"data":{"__typename":"Query"}}]'
```

### 6. GraphQL Engine Identified: Graphene

**Severity:** INFO

**Endpoint:** http://127.0.0.1:5013/graphql

**Description:** The GraphQL engine was identified as Graphene.

**Impact:** None - informational only

**Remediation:** None required
